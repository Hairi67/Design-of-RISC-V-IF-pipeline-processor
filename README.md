# Design-of-RISC-V-IF-pipeline-processor
This project implements a scientific calculator on FPGA using a custom RISC-V processor with both integer (I) and floating-point (F) instruction set support. It was developed as a final-year capstone project at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT), Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering.
